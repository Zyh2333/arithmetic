# Preprocessing
normalizer:
  force_lowercase: False
  strip_accents: False
  force_english_keyboard: False
tokenizer: BPE # faster for sanity checks
vocab_size: 32768 # to make sure there are not memory surprises compared to the actual data

# Dataset Formation
seq_length: 128
include_eot_token_in_corpus: True

max_entries_in_raw_dataset: 1e10 # Select only this many examples from the dataset
max_seq_in_tokenized_dataset: 1e10 # Select only this many tokenized sequences.
# max_seq_in_tokenized_dataset should be just slightly more than budget * 60 * 60 * expected tokens/sec for the single epoch of training

# Data Cleaning:
remove_trash: False
trash_cutoff: 0.3
deduplicate_entries: False
deduplication_threshold: 100

# Data Order:
ordering: randomized # could be a curriculum

# Validation Split
validation_seqs: 128 # how many sequences to reserve for validation
